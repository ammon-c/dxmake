     NAME 
          touch - touch file timestamp 

     SYNOPSIS 
          touch [options] file...  

     DESCRIPTION 
          Touch  changes  the  time/date of last modification for each
          file argument.  

          Options: 

          -d 
              Specifies the date to assign to each file.  The  default
              is the  current system date.  The date must be specified
              in MMDDYY format.  

              Example: 

                  touch -d061785 myfile 

              would change the date on myfile to June 17, 1985.  

          -t 
              Specifies the time to assign to each file.  The  default
              is the  current system time.  The time must be specified
              in 24 HHMM format.  

              Example: 

                  touch -t0945 myfile 

              would change the time on myfile to 9:45am.  

                  touch -t1720 myfile 

              would change the time on myfile to 17:20 (5:20pm).  

          -w 
              Specifies what directory to use as the  current  working
              directory.  The default is the current working directory 
              at the  time  make  is invoked.  The directory name must
              immediately follow the 'w' in the argument list, with no 
              intervening space.  

          -?  
              Outputs the copyright and a summary of the program.   If
              this  argument  is  given,  no  other  arguments  may be
              given.  This option is not available when running  under
              Microsoft Windows.

     NOTES 
          When  running  under  MS-DOS, invoking touch with no command
          line arguments  is  considered  an  error,  and  causes  the
          message "no  files  specified" to be displayed.  However, if
          touch is invoked with no command line arguments when running 
          under Microsoft Windows, a  dialog  box  is  activated  from
          which   the   command   line   arguments   can   be   chosen
          interactively.  Once the desired arguments have been chosen, 
          clicking the 'OK' button continues execution with the chosen 
          arguements, while clicking the  'Cancel'  button  terminates
          execution.  

     FILES 
          None.  

     BUGS 
          None known.
